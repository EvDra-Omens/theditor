    <b>2 January 2021:</b> Quick fix for a bug that was making the editor fields resize incorrectly in Safari. I have only been able to test it in Chrome, Firefox and Safari for iPad; if you run into any problems in other browsers, let me know!
</p>

<p>
    <b>28 December 2020:</b> Important bug fix for a problem that was breaking the editor (the regex pattern I was using to strip code of script and style tags had a typo). It should work now, but still do not hesitate to let me know if you've found any problems!
    <br>
    I also added a few changes to improve mobile display. Resizing should now work on mobile and I have a button for toggling the editor panel visibility. I am testing these through Chrome dev tools, so let me know if it's working right on mobile!

<div id="latest">
    <b>27 December 2020:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Added buttons that allow you to download your code as .txt files. Thank you <a href="https://toyhou.se/anisoptera-eyes">anisoptera-eyes</a> for the suggestion!</li>
        <li>Clear button added.</li>
        <li>Added a text scratchpad as requested. Thank you <a href="https://toyhou.se/Miner5431">Miner5431</a> for the suggestion!</li>
        <li>Under the hood: the preview window is now housed in an iframe. This should prevent issues with class name conflicts that were popping up quite frequently.</li>
        <li>Toggle button for mobile view added and generally made it more friendly to mobile users.</li>
        <li>Overhauled resizing&mdash;it resizes far more smoothly now.</li>
    </ul>
