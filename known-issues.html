<p><b>No select/cut/copy/paste functionality on mobile devices.</b> I will have to look into Ace editor docs to see if there is a workaround for this.</p>

<p><b>Cursor is sometimes visually displaced from actual position.</b> This is a problem with Ace Editor panels not resizing correctly. It is a difficult error to recreate and as such, I have yet to be able to fix it. Currently, refreshing the page will fix it.</p>

<p><b>CSS using the @import rule does not work.</b> I cannot fix this: this syntax is used to reference a protected stylesheet on the Toyhouse website, which is designed to prevent people from stealing them. Without the original CSS code, you can't preview it in this editor.</p>
