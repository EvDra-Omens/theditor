<p><b>Cursor is sometimes visually displaced from actual position.</b> This is a problem with Ace Editor panels not resizing correctly. It is a difficult error to recreate and as such, I have yet to be able to fix it. Currently, refreshing the page will fix it.</p>

<p><b>Page switches back to the first tab whenever code is updated.</b> The reason this happens is that every time you update the code, the page refreshes, because the Ace library has no way of telling me exactly where the new characters were inputted, so you're being presented with a fresh version every time. To prevent this happening would probably be very complicated so I'm uncertain if I can change it.</p>

<p><b>Some Font Awesome icons do not appear correctly.</b> I cannot fix this as I don't have a pro Font Awesome licence. You will have to upload the code to Toyhouse to see how the FA icons appear there.</p>

<p><b>CSS using the @import rule does not work.</b> Again, I cannot fix this: this syntax is used to reference a protected stylesheet on the Toyhouse website, a measure designed to prevent people from stealing them. Without the original CSS code, you can't preview it in this editor.</p>
